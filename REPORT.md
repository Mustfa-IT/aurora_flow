# Aurora Flow - Comprehensive Application Report

## 1. Overview

Aurora Flow is a modern, full-featured task management application built with Flutter. The application provides a Kanban-style interface for organizing tasks, with powerful features for project management, user authentication, and team collaboration. Aurora Flow is designed with a clean, intuitive interface that works seamlessly across multiple platforms including mobile, web, and desktop environments.

## 2. Architecture

The application follows a robust clean architecture approach, separating concerns into distinct layers:

### 2.1 Architectural Layers

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - UI components (widgets)
   - State management (BLoC pattern)
   - Pages and navigation

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Business entities (User, Project, Task, Category)
   - Use cases for business logic
   - Repository interfaces

3. **Data Layer**
   - Repository implementations
   - Remote data sources
   - Data models for API communication

### 2.2 Dependency Injection

Aurora Flow uses the Service Locator pattern (`GetIt`) for dependency injection, allowing for:
- Loose coupling between components
- Easier testability
- Centralized dependency management

The application initializes all dependencies in the `injection_container.dart` file, providing different implementations for web and mobile platforms when needed.

### 2.3 Directory Structure

The project follows a feature-based directory structure:

```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── common/         # Shared design elements
│   ├── config/         # Application configuration
│   ├── utils/          # Utility functions
│   └── widgets/        # Reusable widgets

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 State Management

Aurora Flow implements the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management:

- **AuthBloc**: Manages authentication state including login, registration, session validation, and profile updates
- **ProjectBloc**: Handles project-related operations and state

This approach provides:
- Clear separation of UI and business logic
- Reactive updates to the UI when state changes
- Testable business logic components

#### 4.1.1 BLoC Implementation Details

The BLoC pattern is implemented using the `flutter_bloc` package:

1. **Event-driven Architecture**:
   - Events represent user actions or system events
   - Each event triggers specific state changes
   - Events are processed sequentially

2. **State Transitions**:
   - States represent the current condition of the application
   - States are immutable
   - UI rebuilds in response to state changes

3. **Use Case Integration**:
   - BLoCs delegate business logic to use cases
   - Use cases interact with repositories
   - Clear separation of concerns

### 4.2 Backend Integration

The application connects to a PocketBase backend using:

- **API Communication**: Structured data models and API clients
- **Real-time Updates**: Real-time subscription for user updates
- **File Management**: Support for avatar uploads and retrievals

   - Information is organized by importance
   - Clear visual cues guide user attention

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User actions receive immediate visual feedback
   - State changes are clearly indicated
   - Error states provide actionable information

## 6. Authentication Flow

The authentication system implements a complete workflow:

1. **Initial Entry**: Users start at the landing page with login/register options
2. **Registration**: New users register with email, password, and name
3. **Email Verification**: Required verification step before accessing the app
4. **Login**: Existing users can log in directly
5. **Session Management**: The app maintains authentication state
6. **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information

- Categories contain multiple Tasks
- Tasks can be assigned to multiple Users

### 7.3 Model Implementation

The application uses a clean model architecture:

1. **Entity Classes**:
   - Domain-level entities that represent core business objects
   - Pure Dart classes with business logic
   - Independent of data sources or UI

2. **Model Classes**:
   - Data-layer implementations of entities
   - Include serialization/deserialization logic
   - Handle API-specific data formats

3. **Model Relationships**:
   - Object references maintain relationships
   - Foreign keys map to backend database structure
   - Expanded records for nested data retrieval

## 8. Performance Considerations
